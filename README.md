## Topic Theme
Every frame rendered in a video game, every AI-generated image and every large language model relies on a technology that was originally designed for a much simpler purpose: drawing graphics faster.

The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has undergone one of the most significant architectural transformations in computing history. What began as dedicated hardware for 3D graphics evolved into a massive computing platform that powers artificial intelligence, scientific simulations and modern super computers.

This exhibit explores five major turning points that shaped the evolution of the GPU and examines how it became one of the most important technologies in modern computing.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend Technologies

3. GPU Generation Comparison Tool

* **MDX**
  
MDX will be used to combine written explanations with interactive components in a seamless exhibit format.

It will support:
1. Historical Narratives
2. Technical explanations
3. Embedded interactive visuals

* **CSS**
  
CSS will be used to create a modern digital museum aesthetic inspired by GPU hardware and computing systems.

Design features include:
1. Dark-themed interface
2. Card-based layouts
3. Smooth transitions and animations
4. Responsive desktop/mobile design

### Backend Technologies
| Technology  | Role |  
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Node.js  |  Ensures compatibility with modern JavaScript tooling and supports deployment of the exhibit website.  |
| Express  | Will only be used if needed for additional functionality in future development.  |

* **Node.js**
  
Node.js will be used as the local runtime environment required by Astro for development and build processes.

* **Express**
  
Possible uses:
1. Storing user interaction data (e.g., GPU comparison results)
2. Logging exploration activity
3. Supporting future expansion of interactive components


## I. Exhibit Narrative
### 1.) Introduction: The Rise of GPU
   
Today, GPUs power video games, artificial intelligence, and scientific simulations. However, they were originally designed to solve a much narrower problem: rendering graphics efficiently.

This exhibit explores how that specialized hardware evolved into one of the most important computing platforms in modern history.

### 2.) Before Dedicated Graphics Hardware
Before GPUs existed, all graphics processing was handled by the CPU. 

Topics covered include:
* CPU-based rendering
* Software rasterization
* Performance bottlenecks
* Increasing demand for 3D graphics
  
**Key Idea**:
As graphical demands increased, general-purpose CPUs became insufficient for real-time rendering workloads.


### 3.) Five Turning Points in GPU History
This section is the core of the exhibit and is presented as an interactive timeline.

#### a. Turning Point #1 - 1996
*3dfx Voodoo Graphics*
- First widely successful consumer 3D accelerator

#### b. Turning Point #2 - 1999
*GeForce 256*
- Introduction of the “GPU” concept with hardware transform and lighting

#### c. Turning Point #3 - 2007
*CUDA*
- GPUs become general-purpose parallel computing devices

#### d. Turning Point #4 - 2018
*RTX 20 Series*
- Introduction of ray tracing and AI-assisted rendering hardware

#### e. Turning Point #5 - 2022-Present
*AI Supercomputing Era*
- GPU’s become core infrastructure for AI training and inference

### 4.) Evolution of GPU Architecture

This section explores the major architectural developments that transformed GPUs from specialized graphics accelerators into powerful platforms for scientific computing, real-time rendering, and artificial intelligence.

**Architectural Progression**

    Fixed-Function Pipeline  
    ↓  
    Transform and Lighting Hardware  
    ↓  
    Programmable Shaders  
    ↓  
    CUDA (General-Purpose Computing)  
    ↓  
    RT Cores (Ray Tracing)  
    ↓  
    Tensor Cores (AI Acceleration)
#### Key Takeaway

- Hardware acceleration
- Parallel processing
- Programmable hardware design
- Specialized compute units
- Throughput-oriented architecture


### 5.) GPU Competition (“GPU Wars”)
GPU evolution was strongly shaped by competition between hardware manufacturers.

Topics covered include:
- 3dfx Vs. NVIDIA (Early 3D graphics era)
- NVIDIA Vs. ATI/AMD (GPU standardization era)
- NVIDIA Vs. AMD Vs. Intel (AI computing era)

**Key Idea**:
Competition between companies accelerated architectural innovation and pushed GPUs into new computing domains.

### 6.) Conclusion and Legacy
The GPU is now a foundational component of modern computing systems.

Without GPUs:
- Modern 3D graphics would not exist at scale
- Scientific simulations would be significantly slower
- Machine learning would be impractical
- Large language models would not be feasible

**Final Statement**:

The GPU did not just improve graphics performance, but it also fundamentally changed the nature of computing.
